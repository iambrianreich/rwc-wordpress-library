# rwc-wordpress-library

The Reich Web Consulting WordPress Library is a library that we've built up of
functions and features we find useful for sharing between web projects.

The library is build such that it can be included and utilized as part of a
plugin, or as part of a theme.

## Features

The library provides what it calls *Features*: predefines sets of functionality
that can be included in your project simply telling the library to load the
feature. This methodology allows the feature to be enabled on a per-project
basis and allows us to include a ton of functionality in the library, without
requiring that all of it be loaded for every project.
